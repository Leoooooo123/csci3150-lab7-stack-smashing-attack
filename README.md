# CSCI-3150 Stack Smashing Attack

In this lab tutorial, we introduce you some exciting hacking skills with [GDB](https://kuafu1994.github.io/GDB/). At first, you should have a knowledge on GDB, a very powerful GNU debugger. In fact, we strongly suggest you to do so for its efficiency without infinite amounts of printf statements. Also, it will be great if you can pick up some assembly language, the chapter two of [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) will be wonderful materials. In order to make you have a deeper understanding of Linux stack, we design a small C program which you can hack based on [stack buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow). Don't worry, this lab can be very easy with your basic knowledge of stack, if you have attended Prof Eric LO's lecture.
